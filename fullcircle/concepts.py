# CALLED BY: the drop-in adapter and the structural finder's mapping stage
#            (step A2/A3). Copied into FULL-RESET-GRAPH so it stands alone.
# FIRES WHEN: a target system is first indexed -- to learn how IT labels each concept, so every
#             downstream detector finds a concept regardless of the target's naming.
"""The portability core: classify code by BEHAVIOUR into shared CONCEPTS, then learn the target
system's own LABELS for each concept and store them, so the synonym tool can detect a concept under
any name (Chris, 2026-09-23: "generate the labels and definitions ... then uses the synonym tool to
detect them during the indexing stages").

WHY THIS IS THE LOAD-BEARING PIECE: a detector that keys on names only works on systems shaped like
the ones it was written against. This classifies by what the code DOES (AST behaviour), then RECORDS
the names it observed so a system that calls its gates "guards" or its tests "specs" is still mapped
correctly. Proven by the renamed-fixture test in selftest(): rename every symbol and the
classification does not move.

No third-party deps. AST only, so it never executes the target's code.

    ⛔ WHY THIS IS NOT `os.path.relpath`, and it cost three CI rounds on 2026-09-27. On Windows
    relpath returns `pkg\\test_rel.py`, and anything that KEYS, COMPARES or PUBLISHES that string
    assumes `pkg/test_rel.py`. claimproof's own multi-method selftest keyed its expectations by
    forward slash, so a lookup returned None on Windows and only on Windows -- the test failed
    there while every Linux run stayed green.

    THE DISTINCTION THAT DECIDES WHICH TO USE: a path you are about to OPEN is a filesystem path
    and belongs to the platform -- use `os.path.join`/`relpath` and leave it alone. A path you
    store, key, diff, or write into SARIF is an IDENTIFIER, and an identifier that changes shape
    per platform breaks every reader at once. SARIF requires `/` in a uri regardless of platform,
    so forward slash is the correct answer rather than a convenience for the tests.

    Lives here because `concepts.py` is the contract these repos share, so the definition travels
    with it instead of being re-typed per module (nothing-ships-unwired.md 13-15).
